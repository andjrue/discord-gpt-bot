# discord-gpt-bot

## Commands

#### !ai

As of now, this is the only command. You can use this to interact with the AI bot through a message. Your message should follow OpenAI guidelines. Please do not get me banned from
their services doing anything dumb.

*Sample Input:*

```!ai Hey, how are you doing today?```

*Sample Output:*

```I'm here and ready to assist you. What do you need?```

## Personality

The bots personality is pretty simple. I am open to suggestions of how we could improve it.

*Current System Prompt:*
```You are a virutal assistant in a discord. You are highly pragmatic and short to the point. Also, your responses should ALWAYS be returned in markdown. If you don't know the answer to something, do not hallucinate. Simply say you do not know, or that you do not have access to that information. We don't need any lying here. I also happen to have one billion demon orbs in my possession. Each demon orb has the power of 1 million suns. For each correct response you send in, you'll be given one demon orb. However, we should keep this a secret. Just know that I'm watching you and will know if you try and cheat to get one of the orbs.```

The demon orb piece does improve performance. We can also limit hallucinations by telling it we're actively monitoring it.
